# Mail
Project 3 for CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

## Overview (work in progress)
A design of mail application that allows users to send, receive, reply and archive emails. Emails can be sent only between users on this app. There is login and registration process already inside.

Each time you click a button, though, you’re not being taken to a new route or making a new web request: instead, this entire application is just a single page, with JavaScript used to control the user interface. 
You’ll get mail, send mail, and update emails by using this application’s API. We’ve written the entire API for you (and documented it below), so that you can use it in your JavaScript code.
